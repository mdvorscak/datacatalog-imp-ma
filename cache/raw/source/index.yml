    2009 MCAS Report for Grade 10, by district, for all students 
    Notes:
    2006 Rules/Policies Applied
    	Data Last Updated on October 27, 2009
    	Grade 10 Science and Technology/Engineering results represent the highest performance level attained by class of 2011 students in grades 9 or 10 in any of the four subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Introductory Physics, and Technology/Engineering). In addition, only students enrolled in Massachusetts since October 2007 are included in state-level results; only students enrolled in the same district since October 2007 are included in district-level results; only students enrolled in the same school since October 2007 are included in school-level results.
    	Median student growth percentiles (SGP) are not calculated if number of students included in SGP less than 20.
    	The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education does not rank schools or districts on the basis of MCAS results.
    	For multi-school districts, school results for districts with more than one school include students enrolled for the entire academic school year. District results include all from the district who were tested.
    	For single-school districts, MCAS results for districts that only operate a single school include all students tested in the district. It is fairest to compare results from single-school districts to other district results, rather than to school-level results.

    Support of XML-based requests via the Commonwealth's Service Gateway 
    This is the home of the MassGIS GeoServer-based geospatial web services - open services available to the public as well as government users. These are OpenGeospatial Consortium (OGC) standard WMS (web map service), WFS (web feature service), and WCS (web coverage service) services. This site contains information on accessing, using and developing against MassGIS-maintained "Web Map Service" and "Web Feature Service" services. The services also support the OGC Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) standard. Currently 867 datalayers are available, from landuse and zoning to wetlands and aerial photography. Get maps or information in response to queries (in URL or XML format) in a variety of output formats and almost 4,000 different map projections. Over a dozen state agencies have written application against these services which currently respond to 22,000 requests/day.

    In spring 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey, as part of its Boston 133 Cities Urban Area mapping program, contracted for true-color imagery covering the metropolitan Boston area and beyond. Image type for the entire region (more than 1.7 million acres) is 24-bit, 3-band (red, green, blue) natural color. Each band has pixel values ranging 0-255. Pixel resolution is 30 cm., or approximately one foot. 
     
    Additionally, 30 municipalities participated in the Boston Upgrade of the USGS project; these cities and towns contributed funding for separate flights to produce 4-band (red, green, blue, near-infrared) imagery. Pixel resolution for these images is 15 centimeters (approximately 6 inches). 
     
    This digital orthoimagery can serve a variety of purposes, from general planning, to field reference for spatial analysis, to a tool for data development and revision of vector maps. It can also serve as a reference layer or basemap for myriad applications inside geographic information system (GIS) software.

  :description: The protected and recreational open space datalayer contains the boundaries of conservation lands and outdoor recreational facilities in Massachusetts. The associated database contains relevant information about each parcel, including ownership, level of protection, public accessibility, assessor's map and lot numbers, and related legal interests held on the land, including conservation restrictions. Conservation and outdoor recreational facilities owned by federal, state, county, municipal, and nonprofit enterprises are included in this datalayer. Not all lands in this layer are protected in perpetuity, though nearly all have at least some level of protection.

  :description: This political boundary datalayer has been created from latitude and longitude coordinates found in the 68-volume Harbor and Lands Commission Town Boundary Atlas. This Atlas series, and updates since it was published, describes the legal boundary for each of the 351 municipalities in Massachusetts. These coordinates were recorded from surveys of the location of each boundary marker around the periphery of each community. Each survey was tied into higher order monumented survey control points. The Atlases also include detailed descriptions of each community's boundary and location maps for each of the original boundary marker locations. The original surveys were conducted in the 1890s. The Atlas series was published in the early 1900s and has since been updated by the Survey Section of the Massachusetts Highway Department with changes as they are approved by the legislature.

  :description: Wellhead protection areas are important for protecting the recharge area around public water supply (PWS) groundwater sources. A Zone II is a wellhead protection area that has been determined by hydro-geologic modeling and approved by the Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Drinking Water Program (DWP). In cases where hydro-geologic modeling studies have not been performed and there is no approved Zone II, an Interim Wellhead Protection Area (IWPA) is established based on DEP DWP well pumping rates or default values. Certain land uses may be either prohibited or restricted in both approved (Zone II) and interim (IWPA) wellhead protection areas. For MassDEP's regulatory wording of these zones please see Water Supply Protection Area Definitions.

  :description: The Public Water Supply (PWS) datalayer contains the locations of public community surface and groundwater supply sources and public non-community supply sources as defined in 310 CMR 22.00. The public water supply systems represented in this datalayer are based primarily on information in the DEP's Water Quality Testing System (WQTS) database. The WQTS database is the Department's central database for tracking water supply data. The PWS datalayer also contains the locations of proposed wells that have a defined DEP approved wellhead protection area (Zone IIs). Proposed sources are not currently tracked in WQTS.

  :description: This point datalayer shows the location of 82 acute care hospitals in Massachusetts. Acute care hospitals are those licensed under MGL Chapter 111, section 51 and which contain a majority of medical-surgical, pediatric, obstetric, and maternity beds, as defined by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH). The features in this layer are based on database information provided to MassGIS from the DPH, Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS). The August 2009 update of this dataset limited the features to include only acute care hospitals (and removed other "specialty hospitals"); it replaces the layer formerly known as "Hospitals and Emergency Room Facilities." The August 2009 update kept the ER status data and also added attributes to track the status of trauma centers and teaching hospitals.

  :description: This point datalayer shows the locations of schools in Massachusetts. Schools appearing in this layer are those attended by students in pre-kindergarten through high school. Categories of schools include public, private, charter, collaborative programs, and approved special education. This data was originally developed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) GIS Program based on database information provided by the Massachusetts Department of Education (DOE). The update published in April 2009 was based on listings MassGIS obtained from the DOE as of February 9, 2009.

  :description: |-
    In continuing a policy of promoting renewable and clean energy sources, the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEEA) has put considerable effort into researching development sites for wind-based energy production. A key datalayer in this initiative is a modeled representation of wind velocities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The original wind resource data were developed by Truewind Solutions, LLC under contract to AWS Scientific, Inc. as part of a project jointly funded by the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative (MTC), and Northeast Utilities System. This data has undergone further processing to make it more suitable for analyses that utilize other geographic datalayers maintained by MassGIS. 
     
    MassGIS distributes four raster layers covering all of New England and depicting mean sustained wind speeds calculated at heights of 30, 50, 70 and 100 meters above the surface.
