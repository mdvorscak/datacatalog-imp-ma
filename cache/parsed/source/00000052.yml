  2009 MCAS Report for Grade 10, by district, for all students 
  Notes:
  2006 Rules/Policies Applied
  	Data Last Updated on October 27, 2009
  	Grade 10 Science and Technology/Engineering results represent the highest performance level attained by class of 2011 students in grades 9 or 10 in any of the four subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Introductory Physics, and Technology/Engineering). In addition, only students enrolled in Massachusetts since October 2007 are included in state-level results; only students enrolled in the same district since October 2007 are included in district-level results; only students enrolled in the same school since October 2007 are included in school-level results.
  	Median student growth percentiles (SGP) are not calculated if number of students included in SGP less than 20.
  	The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education does not rank schools or districts on the basis of MCAS results.
  	For multi-school districts, school results for districts with more than one school include students enrolled for the entire academic school year. District results include all from the district who were tested.
  	For single-school districts, MCAS results for districts that only operate a single school include all students tested in the district. It is fairest to compare results from single-school districts to other district results, rather than to school-level results.
