  In spring 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey, as part of its Boston 133 Cities Urban Area mapping program, contracted for true-color imagery covering the metropolitan Boston area and beyond. Image type for the entire region (more than 1.7 million acres) is 24-bit, 3-band (red, green, blue) natural color. Each band has pixel values ranging 0-255. Pixel resolution is 30 cm., or approximately one foot. 
   
  Additionally, 30 municipalities participated in the Boston Upgrade of the USGS project; these cities and towns contributed funding for separate flights to produce 4-band (red, green, blue, near-infrared) imagery. Pixel resolution for these images is 15 centimeters (approximately 6 inches). 
   
  This digital orthoimagery can serve a variety of purposes, from general planning, to field reference for spatial analysis, to a tool for data development and revision of vector maps. It can also serve as a reference layer or basemap for myriad applications inside geographic information system (GIS) software.
